        /*Data Types in Java Data types in Java are of different sizes and values that can be stored in the variable
         that is made as per convenience and circumstances to cover up all test cases. Java has two categories in which
        data types are segregated
        1.Primitive Data Type: such as boolean, char, int, short, byte, long, float, and double.
         The Boolean with uppercase B is a wrapper class for the primitive data type boolean in Java.
        2.Non-Primitive Data Type or Object Data type: such as String, Array, etc. */
