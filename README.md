📝 Introduction
Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language known for its portability, scalability, and robust performance. In this repository, you'll find tutorials, example codes, and practical exercises to guide you on your Java learning journey. 🌱

💡 Why Learn Java?
Cross-Platform: Java applications can run on any device with the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
Popular Language: Java is used in web applications, mobile apps (Android), enterprise software, and more.
Strong Community Support: A massive developer community that contributes to the growth and learning resources.
🛠️ Getting Started
Before you start coding, make sure you have:

Java Development Kit (JDK): Download JDK here
Integrated Development Environment (IDE): You can choose any IDE, such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or VS Code.
🧑‍💻 Core Java Concepts
1. Variables and Data Types
Learn how to declare and use different data types like int, double, char, and boolean.

2. Operators
Understand how to use arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators to manipulate data.

3. Control Flow Statements
Learn how to control the flow of your programs using if-else, switch, loops (for, while, do-while), and conditional operators.

👩‍🏫 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Java is based on OOP principles that help in writing organized, reusable code. These core concepts include:

1. Classes and Objects
Understand how to define classes and create objects in Java.

2. Inheritance
Learn how to inherit properties and methods from a parent class to promote code reuse.

3. Polymorphism
Understand the ability of objects to take many forms with method overloading and overriding.

4. Encapsulation
Learn how to protect data and restrict access to the internals of your class.

5. Abstraction
Explore abstract classes and interfaces to define essential features without specifying the full details.

📘 Additional Topics
1. Exception Handling
Handle errors and exceptions using try, catch, finally, and custom exceptions to ensure your programs run smoothly.

2. Collections Framework
Explore the Java Collections Framework, including ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and more for efficient data storage and manipulation.

3. Java I/O
Learn how to perform input and output operations, read/write files using streams, and manage file handling.

4. Multithreading
Understand how to create and manage multiple threads in Java to perform concurrent tasks.
